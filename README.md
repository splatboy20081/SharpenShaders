# VibranceShaders
A shaderpack that currently applies TAA sharpen, I'm working on water.

## Checklist
 1. Add TAA (Suggested by uvraj a.k.a. Yes.)
 2. (nothing)

### Errors
Currently there are a couple errors, but they worked in 2016 when I first worked on shaders.
Please do commit if you find any errors that you can understand, because I welcome feedback.
